  "body": "Justin has been producing online courses for YouTube, Udemy, and his website CodingForEntrepreneurs.com for over 5 years.\r\n\r\nRight now Justin mainly focuses on web development with Python, Django, React, Angular, Html, css, Bootstrap and Javascript. He also has content on Machine Learning and AI.\r\n\r\nI think of Justin as a mentor, teacher, and peer. An odd combination. He's a mentor because he's been producing online content for a longer time than me and has great insights. A teacher because he was the one I learned web development from. And a peer because we're both online content creators.\r\n\r\nJustin and I talk about:\r\n\r\nHis life as an \"Entrepreneur first, programmer out of necessity\"\r\nHis experiences learning to program and what gave him the confidence to get started\r\nPersonal business successes and failures\r\nHow he got started programming\r\nThe exciting time we live in regarding software development and how it empowers people to do incredible things\r\nHis experiences with students, answering questions and inspiring others to learn software development",
